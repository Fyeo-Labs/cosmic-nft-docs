Your json file needs to be in the correct format which is attached. click this link, do not format in .txt this is just a link:
[Cosmic_json.txt](https://github.com/Fyeo-Labs/cosmic-nft-docs/files/15263931/Cosmic_json.txt)
Here is an image showing the parts that you need to change highlighted in yellow. Note, you can have more or less attributes than this sample as long as the formatting is the same. Anything not in yellow please leave as is.

5. Upload your images. Again, click up upload items (the same button you used for the json) and upload your images. Make sure the files names match what is in the json. This will take a lot of time. For collections over 100 it could take as much as 30 minutes. Please do not refresh page, just be patient. Watch this video: https://share.vidyard.com/watch/XTx5aqbBCMQyHCxEfSJ3aA<br>

6. Click create to create collection.
