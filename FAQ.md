<p><b>1. What Browser Can I Use?</b><br>
We ask that everyone use the Chrome browser for interacting with the Cosmic Xahau Platform for the best user experience.

For now, we have disabled minting on mobile until Star commmand has time to test the experience on smaller screen sizes.

<p><b>7. I pressed mint but I don't see any NFT minted, where is it?</b><br>
Chances are you were not signed in when you pressed mint. Unless you were already connected (top right of screen) when you press mint it will ask you to sign a transaction to log in. This is not minting, just signing in. Once you are signed in you can try mint and it will ask you to sign a remit transaction. You will know you are minting because you will see the price.
<p><b>8. The site isn't loading.</b><br>
Try typing just cosmicxahau.com into your chrome browser, no www. That should fix it.
